  <p>We are available by email at the address provided in the “How to Contact Us” Section to address any concerns a user may have regarding the Service. Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner. For any dispute you have with the Company, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.

  <p>If we do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to section “Initial Dispute Resolution” above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration.<br>
    All claims arising out of or relating to these ToS (including its formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered on a confidential basis by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these ToS, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these ToS is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
